# NodeBB Cash MOD

This plugin creates a virtual currency system for your NodeBB forum. Users can then earn cash based on the quality of their posts (ie. bigger posts earn more points).

The amount earned per character can be defined in the Cash ACP, as well as the name of the currency itself.

Top earners can be seen at /users/cash.

## Installation

    npm install nodebb-plugin-cash
